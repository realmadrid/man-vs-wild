# A Story of Man vs Wild

## Story Background
The viewer is participating a reality show in which the viewer could win a prize of $1,000,000 if he/she achieves surviving on the island for 1 year. 

## Story Structure
The story consists of 3 scenes: the beach, the forest and the camp. Not like other stories, these scenes will not be played only once. The viewer (let's call it survivor) will switch between the scenes as the story goes.

### What are the common elements of 3 scenes:
* **Survivor's bag and health points**  
At the bottom of the screen the viewer (let's call it survivor) can see an empty grey box and the health points. The grey box is the survivor's bag which is used for displaying some tools or food the survivor gets. If the survivor interacts with some items, they might be automatically collected to the bag. Then the survivor could interact with some collected items by mouse clicks. The health points mean the survivor's health condition, which keeps reducing every several seconds. To survive on the island, the survivor must seek food and keep good health condition.  

* **Navigation arrows**  
At the left bottom corner and/or right bottom corner there are yellow navigation arrows which will lead the survivor to the previous/next scene. Some arrows will only appear after the survivor interacts with the current scene for a short period of time. Once the arrow appears, it will take the attention of the survivor and lead the survivor to other scenes. In addition, the text of the arrows would change after the other scenes being explored. For example, the text of the navigation arrow in the first scene would change from "explore the island" to "go to forest".  

### What are the scenes:
* Scene1: the beach  
This is the first scene where the story begins. The sea and the beach are beautiful, but the survivor should find some food for surviving. It is very easy to notice that coconuts can be obtained by clicking on the coconut palms. However, a tool is necessary to crack the coconuts. This might let the survivor down, but survival is never a easy thing.  

* Scene2: the forest  
In the forest, the survivor can collect some red mushrooms for instant supplement, but the chicken can't be hunted because of lacking tools.  

* Scene3: an abandoned camp  
It is exciting to discover a camp like this where the survivor can get some tools or food. Actually, in real survival TV shows there is no available artificial tools, this scene is intended to simplify the story. With the tools obtained in the camp, the survivor can go back to the previous scenes and then hunt the chicken or drink the coconut.  

## What I want the viewer feel
Survival is not a game. Some viewers might feel disappointed when they can't drink the coconuts or hunt the wild animals, but meanwhile they would be motivated to explore the following scenes and see what will happen. The coconut and chicken in the first two scenes can't be collected into the bag instantly, so I made some mushrooms (although the message box says the mushrooms taste not that good as they look) in the second scene to encourage the viewer to continue exploring.  

After getting the tools from the third scene, the viewer can do what they failed in the previous scenes. The animation of roasting chicken will be played in the third scene if the viewer clicks on the chicken he/she hunted with the tool. This would be the most exciting moment in this story. 


## What I want to communicate with the viewer
Living in the modern world, many people, like me, would like to experience the life that surviving alone in an island which can make us get rid of the boring stuff in real life. Obviously, surviving in an uninhabited island is far more complex and challenging than this story. Again, it is never a easy thing. Surviving is hundreds of times harder than we expect, which would be very dangerous and fatal. Taking new adventure is interesting and living in a new environment is exciting, but a survivor must learn expertise, practice skills and train himself for months before accepting the challenge.  

When we confront some problems that can't be addressed instantly, we shouldn't be depressed. Instead, we can explore the future and try to find ideas or tools that resolve our problems.  

## What do I hope the viewer tells their friends about this story
I hope the viewer could remember this story and tell their friends to have a try. Maybe some of the viewers will watch the survival TV shows on YouTube. These shows are both entertaining and educational. I hope they enjoy my work and the TV shows.

## About the background images
The background images are created by myself. I applied what I have learned in this course to the main sketch and three background images. The source code is separated from the *sketch.js*, which can be found in *draw-scene1.js*, *draw-scene2.js* and *draw-scene3.js*.  

## Future work
To make the simplified story more complete, more scenes, plants, animals, tools, accidental events, weather system, island map, event notebook, animations, interactive means, sound effects can be included, the tasks can also be more challenging. I think it even can be re-developed as a sandbox story-telling game.
